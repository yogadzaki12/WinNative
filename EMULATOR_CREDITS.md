# Emulator & Library Credits

WinNative's retro-console features are built on open-source emulators and libraries.
This project is distributed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0** (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)).
In compliance with the GPL and the other licenses below, the corresponding source code
for every GPL/copyleft component is available from the upstream projects linked here,
and their copyright and license notices are preserved.

## PlayStation 2

PS2 games are recognized and imported into the library. PS2 emulation is built on
**ARMSX2** (a GPL-3.0 fork of PCSX2) and is in active development.

| ARMSX2 | PS2 emulation + RetroAchievements | GPL-3.0 | https://github.com/ARMSX2/ARMSX2 |
| PCSX2 | Upstream project ARMSX2 is derived from | GPL-3.0 | https://github.com/pcsx2/pcsx2 |

## GameCube / Wii

GameCube and Wii games are recognized and imported into the library. GC/Wii emulation is
built on an embedded build of **Dolphin**, rendered on Vulkan and driven entirely by
WinNative (Dolphin's own UI is stripped). Local and online multiplayer use Dolphin's own
native NetPlay engine.
