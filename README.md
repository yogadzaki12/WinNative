## WinNative: A Community Built Windows Emulation App for Android

**WinNative** is an advanced, high-performance Windows (x86_64) emulation environment for Android. It bridges the gap between desktop gaming and mobile by unifying the best technologies from **Winlator Bionic** and **Pluvia**.

Designed for enthusiasts and power users, WinNative delivers the full Winlator experience while making it easy to connect your Steam, Epic, and GOG game libraries.

### Installation

1. **Download:** Get the latest APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/WinNative-Emu/WinNative/releases) section.

   - `Ludashi`: Forces both Max GPU and CPU clocks on some devices. (Performance Mode trigger).
   - `Vanilla`: Standard package name for side-loading with other forks.
   -  `Antutu`: Forces Max GPU clocks on most devices. (antunu benchmark spoof)
   -  `Pubg`: Standard pubg package name which allows some Game Booster advanced Features.
3. **Setup:** Launch the app, allow the ImageFS to install, and start adding your games manually or sync your library.

### How to Build

**Requirements:** Android Studio, JDK 17, NDK `27.3.13750724`, and CMake.

1. **Clone the repository and update submodules** (Required):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MaxsTechReview/WinNative.git
   cd WinNative
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
2. **Build via Android Studio:** Open the `WinNative` directory, let Gradle sync, then select **Build > Build APK(s)**.
3. **Build via CLI:** Run `.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug` (Windows).

### Retro Console Support

WinNative can also run classic console games alongside your PC library. Retro games live in the same Library and launch just like PC games, but run on an embedded libretro backend instead of Wine.

Supported systems (bundled cores):

| System | Core | ROM extensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NES | FCEUmm | `.nes` `.unf` `.unif` |
| SNES | Snes9x | `.smc` `.sfc` `.swc` `.fig` |
| Game Boy / Color | Gambatte | `.gb` `.gbc` |
| Game Boy Advance | mGBA | `.gba` |
| Genesis / Mega Drive, Master System, Game Gear | Genesis Plus GX | `.gen` `.md` `.smd` `.sms` `.gg` |
| Nintendo 64 | Mupen64Plus-Next | `.n64` `.z64` `.v64` |
| PlayStation | Beetle PSX | `.cue` `.chd` `.pbp` `.m3u` `.iso` |
| PlayStation 2 | ARMSX2 (PCSX2 fork) | `.iso` `.chd` `.cso` `.bin` |

Cores are compiled **from source** as part of `assembleDebug` (see `cores/` for the
libretro cores and `armsx2/build-emucore.sh` for the PS2 core); the Mupen64Plus-Next N64
core ships prebuilt for now. PlayStation 2 online play is supported through the
emulated DEV9 network adapter (see the in-game **Online** tab).

**How to use:** In the Library, tap **Add Custom Game** and select a ROM instead of an `.exe`. WinNative detects the console and adds the game to your Library. Tap **Play** to launch it with on-screen touch controls and physical gamepad support; the in-game menu (Back button or on-screen **MENU**) offers save/load state, reset, and fast-forward. PlayStation and PlayStation 2 BIOS files can be imported from **Settings → Retro**.
